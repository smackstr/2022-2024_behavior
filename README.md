# Video Footage of Behavior Using Raspberry Pi

## What this project does
This project contains scripts to test, capture, convert (.h264 to .mp4), and upload to Google Drive the videos captured from a Raspberry Pi and its associated camera. The scripts were run simultaneously on 2-10 Raspberry Pis up to 4 times per day to capture footage from behavioral experiments with frogs and toads.
