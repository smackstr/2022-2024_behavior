# Data Capture (Video Footage of Behavior Using Raspberry Pi), Cleaning, Wrangling, and Analysis for Behavioral Experiments with Frogs and Toads

## What this project does
This project contains both Python and R scripts 
- (1) to test, capture, convert (.h264 to .mp4), and upload to Google Drive the videos captured from a Raspberry Pi and its associated camera. The scripts were run simultaneously on 2-10 Raspberry Pis up to 4 times per day to capture footage from behavioral experiments with frogs and toads.
- (2) clean, wrangle, and analyze output .csv files that contain x-y coordinates and timestamps from behavioral tracking program (EthoVision)
